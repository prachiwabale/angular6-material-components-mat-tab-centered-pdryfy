          <mat-tab label="Air Nomads">
            <p>The Air Nomads were a civilization composed of people who practiced the art of airbending. While nomadic, Air
              Nomads did inhabit four major air temples, each built on remote locations, only easily reachable with flying
              bison. The Air Nomads were a highly spiritual group of people.</p>

            <p>The Water Tribe is a collective term for people, some of whom practice the art of waterbending, who follow a
              government system in the form of a tribal chiefdom. Although members of the Water Tribe typically inhabit the
              polar regions, the North Pole and the South Pole, there is a small population of waterbenders who inhabit the
              Foggy Swamp in Earth Kingdom territory. The two main tribes are the Northern Water Tribe at the North Pole
              and the Southern Water Tribe at the South Pole.</p>
